      about: 'Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency launched in January 2009 with the first genesis block mined on 9th January 2009. It is a decentralized digital currency that is based on cryptography. As such, it can operate without the need of a central authority like a central bank or a company. It is unlike government-issued or fiat currencies such as US Dollars or Euro in which they are controlled by the country’s central bank. The decentralized nature allows it to operate on a peer-to-peer network whereby users are able to send funds to each other without going through intermediaries.',

       about: "Solana is a Layer 1 blockchain that offers users fast speeds and affordable costs. It supports smart contracts and facilitates the creation of decentralized applications (dApps). Projects built on Solana include a variety of DeFi platforms as well as NFT marketplaces, where users can buy Solana-based NFT projects. Its high performance means Solana doesn’t require a traditional scaling Layer 2 solution; instead, Layer 2s on Solana focus on interoperability and connecting Solana to other chains. To solve the blockchain trilemma, where developers have to balance decentralization, security and scalability when building blockchains, Solana combines the Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus mechanism alongside the more common Proof-of-Stake. This lets Solana achieve consensus more quickly by reducing the workload.Proof-of-History is a time-based consensus mechanism that develops a historical record of an activity based on its position in the blockchain, which is represented by a hash tree. This lets any node quickly verify the order of all transactions by checking the hashes on the hash tree, allowing for fast and efficient validation without requiring the nodes to store the full history of every transaction.",

As the first blockchain to feature smart contracts, it has the largest ecosystem of decentralized applications, ranging from decentralized exchanges to crypto lending and borrowing platforms and more.   Ethereum is also home to numerous Layer 2 solutions that offer users a cheaper and faster way to process transactions on the blockchain. Some of these solutions include Arbitrum, which rolls up multiple transactions into a single transaction on Ethereum, and Polygon’s Proof-of-Stake chain, which is a sidechain that runs parallel to the Ethereum blockchain.
